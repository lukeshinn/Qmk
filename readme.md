<h1> This repo contains the same code as whats in https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware with one difference! </h1>
<p> The default keymap is reversed! I soldered the microprocessors upside down and had to rearrange the keymap to remedy this. If you've got a nyquist build going and you made the same mistake I did, save some time by taking code from my default-keymap.c! </p>
